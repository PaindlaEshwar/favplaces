        <h1 class="head"> Warangalfort</h1>
    
        <p class="p1">The construction of Warangal Fort was started by the Kakatiya King Ganapati Deva during the 13th century. The history of Warangal fort is symbolic of the history of the Kakatiya rule to an extent. It was built as King Ganapatideva has shifted the capital of the Kakatiya kingdom to Warangal from Hanamkonda. This fort stands 12 km away from the Hanamkonda. Later his daughter Rani Rudrama, who also headed over the Kakatiya reign after her father, looked after the completion of this fort. Later King Prataparudra II who was also known as Rudradeva II, the last ruler of Kakatiya Kingdom, also made considerable addition to the Warangal Fort.
            This fort withstood many attacks, which led to destruction of its various parts. In 1309, Malik Kafur who was the general of Alauddin Khilji had launched an attack on the fort during the rule of Prataparudra II. An army consisting of around 1000,000 men attacked the fort in a battle that lasted for many months. The fort was then defended by the King Prataparudra II and his army. Later, many a times, Warangal fort was attacked by the Sultans of Delhi as well.
            Eventually this Qutub Shahi Dynasty took the control of this fort, later it was under the rule of Hyderabad Nizams.
