                 Marco Polo, during his visit to the Kakatiya empire, supposedly called the temple "the brightest star in the galaxy of temples".[6] In July 2021, Ramappa Temple was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                Bogatha is colloquially called as "the Telangana Niagara" and "Telangana Niagara jalapatham".[2][4] its a nice scenery to go and visit there is a well maintained park and tower to see around
